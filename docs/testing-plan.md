# Testing Plan for Project

## Introduction

This document outlines the testing strategy for the project, including the methodology, tools, and organization of tests. Testing is a critical part of our development process to ensure high-quality and reliable features, both in isolation and as an integrated system.

## Test Categories

Testing will be organized into **functional** and **non-functional** categories, with both **backend** and **frontend** tests. Additionally, we will include tests for the entire system and acceptance testing for combined components (backend and frontend together). 

### **Functional Tests**
Functional tests ensure that the application behaves as expected by testing individual components, interactions, and workflows.

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual units of code (e.g., functions, methods, small components).
- **Integration Tests**: Test interactions between components (e.g., API endpoints, database interactions, frontend-backend integration).

### **Non-Functional Tests**
Non-functional tests focus on non-business requirements, such as performance, security, usability, and compatibility.

- **Performance Tests**: Test the performance aspects of the system (e.g., load times, scalability).
- **Security Tests**: Test for vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- **Usability Tests**: Assess the user experience and interface clarity.
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: Ensure compatibility with multiple browsers.

### **Combined Tests**
These tests focus on the system as a whole, ensuring that all components (backend and frontend) work together correctly.

- **System Tests**: End-to-end testing of the entire system to ensure all components work together seamlessly.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate real user scenarios, testing both frontend and backend together.


## Folder Structure

The tests will be organized as follows:

```
/BOOK-HUB
  /backend
    /tests
      /functional
        /unit
        /integration
          /api
      /non-functional
        /performance
        /security

  /frontend
    /tests
      /functional
        /unit
        /integration
      /non-functional
        /performance
        /security
        /usability
        /cross-browser

  /tests
    /combined
      /system
      /end-to-end
```

## Backend Testing

The **backend tests** will be structured into **functional** and **non-functional** categories, as follows:

### **Functional Tests**
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Test individual functions or components in isolation, such as CRUD operations, utilities, and services.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - **API Tests**: Test the interactions between the backend components, ensuring API endpoints are correctly wired with the database and other services.

### **Non-Functional Tests**
- **Performance Tests**: 
  - Test how the backend performs under load, measuring response times, scalability, and system resource usage.
- **Security Tests**: 
  - Test the backend for potential security vulnerabilities like SQL injections, XSS, and other common web vulnerabilities.

## Frontend Testing

The **frontend tests** will also be structured into **functional** and **non-functional** categories, as follows:

### **Functional Tests**
- **Unit Tests**:
  - Test individual frontend components, such as buttons, forms, and UI elements.
- **Integration Tests**:
  - Test how frontend components interact with each other, verifying that data flows correctly and APIs are called as expected.

### **Non-Functional Tests**
- **Performance Tests**: 
  - Measure the speed and responsiveness of the frontend, such as page load times and UI rendering performance.
- **Security Tests**: 
  - Ensure that the frontend is secure, testing for vulnerabilities such as XSS or misconfigured access control.
- **Usability Tests**: 
  - Evaluate the user interface, ensuring that the system is intuitive and user-friendly.
- **Cross-Browser Tests**: 
  - Ensure compatibility with different web browsers, testing if the frontend renders and functions consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

## Combined Testing

### **System Tests**
These tests will validate the integration of both the backend and frontend, ensuring the full system works as intended. The entire flow will be tested, from data input to UI rendering, to ensure that the different components interact smoothly.

### **End-to-End Tests**
End-to-end tests simulate a real user scenario, from interacting with the frontend UI to triggering backend services and validating the end result. These tests cover a broader scope than integration tests, verifying that the full application is functioning correctly from the user's perspective.

### **API-Frontend Interaction Tests**
This testing focuses on ensuring that the frontend interacts correctly with the backend APIs. It involves verifying that API calls return the expected data, the frontend properly handles responses (including errors), and data is displayed correctly in the UI.

## Testing Tools

### **Backend**
- **Pytest**: Primary testing framework for unit and integration tests.
- **Locust**: For performance and load testing (backend).
- **OWASP ZAP**: For security vulnerability testing (backend).

### **Frontend**
- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **Selenium**: For automated browser interactions during frontend tests.
- **Cypress**: For end-to-end testing.
- **Lighthouse**: For performance testing (frontend).
- **SonarQube**: For static code analysis, including security vulnerabilities.

## CI/CD Integration

The tests will be integrated into the continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. The pipeline will be configured to run the relevant tests at different stages of the development process. For example:
- Unit tests will run on every pull request.
- Integration and end-to-end tests will run on feature branches before merging.
- Non-functional tests (performance, security) will be executed periodically or before releases.

## Conclusion

This testing plan ensures that our application is thoroughly tested at different levels and components, from individual units of code to the full system. By categorizing tests into functional and non-functional, and using a structured folder organization, we can efficiently test both backend and frontend while ensuring overall system quality.
